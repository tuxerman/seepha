Yet another attempt to curate stuff I've written over time.  

Once upon a time there was [a blog](http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.com) on Blogger, where all posts dated before the summer of 2016 appeared originally.  

**Why "See Pha"?**

A mysterious symbol I had spotted often while travelling on trains in India: A board with 'W/L', or 'See/Pha' in the Devanagari script - both of which were an indication for the driver to blow the whistle (or sound the horn) since a level-crossing was coming up. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I found out what it signalled, but until then the phrase "See Pha" remained a curious oddity in my head.
